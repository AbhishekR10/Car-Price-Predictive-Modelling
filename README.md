Car Price Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting car prices based on various features such as mileage, year of manufacture, brand, and more.
Features:
Data Cleaning: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring high-quality data for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis was performed to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on car prices. Visualizations were created to uncover insights and patterns in the data.
Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms were explored, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques were employed to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: The models were evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared to assess their accuracy and generalization capability.

Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Run the Google collabaratory to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Use the trained model to make predictions on new car data or integrate it into your own applications.

Contributions:
Contributions to improve the model's accuracy, efficiency, or usability are welcome! Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
